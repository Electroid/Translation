# Translation
Javascript API to translate text using Google's App Script

### Set Up

 - Go to the app script [homepage](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) for information on how to use scripts
 - Insert `Code.gs` into your project
 - Deploy as a web application and enjoy free translation

### Future
I hope to create lightweight APIs in other languages (Java, Ruby, Swift, Python). You could help by making pull requests for those.
